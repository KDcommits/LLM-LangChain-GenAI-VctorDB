In a recent tweet, Musk put out a statement from Tesla that it was concerned about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin (price in India) mining and transaction, and hence was suspending vehicle purchases using the cryptocurrency.\n",

It triggered a downward spiral for Bitcoin value but the cryptocurrency has stabilised since.  A number of Twitter users welcomed Musk's statement. One of them said it's time people started realising that Dogecoin is here to stay and another referred to Musk's previous assertion that crypto could become the world's future currency.\"\"\""
